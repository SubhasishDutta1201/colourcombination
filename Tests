1. In the first prototype [file: Prototypes/PressureSensor_1], the fabrics are cut in a round shape staying within the limits of the breadth of each side of the frame as I am intending to fix the sensors on three of the four edges. But after the initial hassle of cutting the fabrics in a round shape (which does not seem as easy as it looks), it was quite small to hold and thus difficult to sew (given my rudimentary sewing skills). So I decided to cut the fabrics in a square shape [file: Prototypes/PressureSensorComponents], thus making the cutting much more easier and also will keep the sewing quite simple. 

2. In the first prototype [file: Prototypes/PressureSensor_1], the leads of the pressure sensor are covered completely by the non conductive fabrics on both sides. This might be a problem later on when these leads have to be connected to the leads of the RGB LED and the battery using conductive threads and these threads need to be sewed to the leads and might be a problem if the leads are covered. So, in the second prototype [file: Prototypes/PressureSensor_3], the leads are kept longer than the breadth of the non-conductive fabric so that they are visible outside and thus they can easily be connected to the leads of the LED without going through any other non-conductive layer. 

3. A video is added [file: Video] where it is clerly shown how the pressure sensors are tested using a 9V battery and a multimeter to check if they are transmitting current when pressed upon, then the connections are made and finally the working of the entire circuit is shown.
