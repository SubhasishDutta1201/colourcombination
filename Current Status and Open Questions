Status

1. Have settled on the right shape of the sensors and how the conductive fabrics should be cut with leads extending beyond the non-concutive fabrics on both sides to add in making the connections with the conductive thread.

2. Have placed an order for crocodile wires and a sewable coin cell battery holder which will be sewed onto a cloth which is attached to the frame. The crocodile wires will be needed to help in checking the connections and see if the pressure sensors are working as planned. 

3. Have solved the open question of how to connect the leads of the RGB LED with a conductive thread. The solution is bending the RGB LED's leads into a round shape using pliers and then threading the conductive wire through the respective leads.

Open Questions

1. How to make a series connection using conductive threads? Have to read up a bit about that.
