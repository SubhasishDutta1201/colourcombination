In the first prototype [file: Prototype1], the pressure sensor is created in the exact same way as shown in the Schematic Diagram in README. In the second prototype [file: Prototype2 and file:PressureSensor_components], the various components are cut in a different way. The square shapes of the fabrics gives is easier to cut than a round shape and also the shape will help in sewing together the materials.
