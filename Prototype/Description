In the first prototype [file: PressureSensor_1], the pressure sensor is created in the exact same way as shown in the Layered View in README. In the second prototype [file: PressureSensor_2 and file:PressureSensorComponents], the various components are cut in a different way. The square shapes of the fabrics gives is easier to cut than a round shape and also the shape will help in sewing together the materials.
