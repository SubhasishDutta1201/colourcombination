In this idea, three fabric based pressure sensors will be created which will be connected to the three leads of the RGB LED to control each colour.  Pressing any of the three pressure sensors individually will trigger the LED to emit either red, green or blue colours. On pressing two of these three sensors together, the RGB LED will get triggered to emit either yellow, cyan or magenta and on pressing all three, the LED will emit white light. The pressure with which the user presses the sensors will regulate the amount of brightness of the emitted light.
