An RGB LED is a combination of three coloured (Red, Green, Blue) LEDs combined in a single package. It has 4 leads - the longest one being either common anode or common cathode lead depending on the type of the LED and the rest of the leads correspond to each of the three colours. We then connect the common anode/cathode lead to the positive/negative lead of a battery which powers the LED, and then each of the other colour leads to different power inputs to switch on and off each colour. Combining these primary colours (R,G and B) will result in different colours depending on the intensity which is applied to each lead.
